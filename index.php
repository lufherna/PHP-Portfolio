				<p class="aboutMe3"> My name is Luis Hernandez. I'm an aspiring Web Developer and i enjoy learning how to code. I was employed by OCPS for over a year and worked as a TSR helping people with their computer problems. Working with people and helping them with their problems is a passion of mine. I also went did a short course on bartending so if you want a delicious cocktail, i can certainly help you out with that. </p>
				<p class="aboutMe4">When i came back down to Florida i noticed everyone has changed and had their own things going on. I was stuck at a dead-end job, but enjoyed working with the great people that were there. </p>
				<p class="aboutMe5">When I'm not working I'm either: at the gym, going out for a drink (an Old Fashioned is my favorite), traveling out of state, or studying coding. You can contact me with the information to right. Hope to hear from you soon!
